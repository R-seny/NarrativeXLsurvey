They belonged to a society whose object was to lure the\n\nLondon public by the force of example towards the adoption of the early\n\nGreek fashions and the simpler Greek attitudes.  A friend of Flossie's\n\nhad thrown in her lot with them, but could never be induced to abandon\n\nher umbrella.  They also, as Joan told herself, were reformers.

Still, the\n\nPresident made it the subject of a special message, and thus became\n\n\"official\" what had before only reached the world in a very\n\nindefinite shape.  Then began that wonderful development, and the\n\ngreat emigration to California, by land and by sea, of 1849 and\n\n1850.\n\n\n\nAs before narrated, Mason, Warner, and I, made a second visit to\n\nthe mines in September and October, 1848.  As the winter season\n\napproached, Colonel Mason returned to Monterey, and I remained for\n\na time at Sutter's Fort.  In order to share somewhat in the riches\n\nof the land, we formed a partnership in a store at Coloma, in\n\ncharge of Norman S. Bestor, who had been Warner's clerk.  We\n\nsupplied the necessary money, fifteen hundred dollars (five hundred\n\ndollars each), and Bestor carried on the store at Coloma for his\n\nshare.  Out of this investment, each of us realized a profit of\n\nabout fifteen hundred dollars.  Warner also got a regular leave of\n\nabsence, and contracted with Captain Sutter for surveying and\n\nlocating the town of Sacramento.  He received for this sixteen\n\ndollars per day for his services as surveyor; and Sutter paid all\n\nthe hands engaged in the work.  The town was laid off mostly up\n\nabout the fort, but a few streets were staked off along the river\n\nbank, and one or two leading to it.  Captain Sutter always\n\ncontended, however, that no town could possibly exist on the\n\nimmediate bank of the river, because the spring freshets rose over\n\nthe bank, and frequently it was necessary to swim a horse to reach\n\nthe boat-landing.  Nevertheless, from the very beginning the town\n\nbegan to be built on the very river-bank, viz., First, Second, and\n\nThird Streets, with J and K Streets leading back.  Among the\n\nprincipal merchants and traders of that winter, at Sacramento, were\n\nSam Brannan and Hensley, Reading & Co.  For several years the site\n\nwas annually flooded; but the people have persevered in building\n\nthe levees, and afterward in raising all the streets, so that\n\nSacramento is now a fine city, the capital of the State, and stands\n\nwhere, in 1848, was nothing but a dense mass of bushes, vines, and\n\nsubmerged land.  The old fort has disappeared altogether.\n\n\n\nDuring the fall of 1848, Warner, Ord, and I, camped on the bank of\n\nthe American River, abreast of the fort, at what was known as the\n\n\"Old Tan-Yard.\"  I was cook, Ord cleaned up the dishes, and Warner\n\nlooked after the horses; but Ord was deposed as scullion because he\n\nwould only wipe the tin plates with a tuft of grass, according to\n\nthe custom of the country, whereas Warner insisted on having them\n\nwashed after each meal with hot water.  Warner was in consequence\n\npromoted to scullion, and Ord became the hostler.

The peanut oil served to give a hint of\n\nthe animal food we hungered for.  It was greasy, and as we did not have\n\nany meat for three months, even this flimsy substitute was inexpressibly\n\ngrateful to palate and stomach.

Yes, indeed, he is.

At the same time, since the\n\nhuman mind has its limits, and since human life has its limits, a\n\nminister of all men must make up his mind to limit himself to the best\n\nknowledge; the knowledge, that is, that chiefly concerns him,--the\n\nknowledge of God so far as God has made Himself known, and the knowledge\n\nof Christ.  He must be a student of his Bible night and day and all his\n\ndays.  If he has not the strength of understanding and memory to read his\n\nBible easily in the original Hebrew and Greek, let him all the more make\n\nup for that by reading it the oftener and the deeper in English.  Let him\n\nnot only read his Bible deeply for his sermons and prayers, lectures and\n\naddresses, let him do that all day every day of the week, and then read\n\nit all night, and every night of the week, for his own soul.  Let every\n\nminister know his Bible down to the bottom, and with his Bible his own\n\nheart.  He who so knows his Bible and with it his own heart has almost\n\nbooks enough.  All else is but ostentatious apparatus.

And, then, for the outside knowledge of\n\nthe passing day he will read the newspapers, and though he gives up all\n\nthe morning to the newspapers, and returns to them again in the evening,\n\nhis conscience will not upbraid him if he reads as Jonathan Edwards read\n\nthe newsletters of his day,--to see how the kingdom of heaven is\n\nprospering in the earth, and to pray for its prosperity.  And, then, by\n\nthat time, and when he has got that length, all other kinds of knowledge\n\nwill have fallen into its own place, and will have taken its own proper\n\nproportion of his time and his thought.

As it is necessary that I should explain this obscure corner of\n\nour history, I must tell you that this agitation, starting from Fouche's\n\nown hand (which held the wires of the former Montagne), produced\n\nrepublican plots against the life of the First Consul, which was in\n\nperil from this cause long after the victory of Marengo.

The Greek ell is equal to one foot and a half\n\nEnglish.]--in height and their breadth was so great, that two chariots\n\ncould conveniently drive abreast upon them. These mighty defences were\n\ncrowned and strengthened by two hundred and fifty high towers, and even\n\nthese would have been insufficient, if Babylon had not been protected on\n\none side by impassable morasses. The gigantic city lay on both shores\n\nof the Euphrates. It was more than forty miles in circumference, and\n\nits walls enclosed buildings surpassing in size and grandeur even the\n\nPyramids and the temples of Thebes.\n\n\n\n   [These numbers and measurements are taken partly from Herodotus,\n\n   partly from Diodorus, Strabo and Arrian. And even the ruins of this\n\n   giant city, writes Lavard, are such as to allow a very fair\n\n   conclusion of its enormous size. Aristotle (Polit. III. I.) says\n\n   Babylon's dimensions were not those of a city, but of a nation.]\n\n\n\nThe mighty gates of brass, through which the royal train entered the\n\ncity, had opened wide to receive this noble company. This entrance was\n\ndefended on each side by a strong tower, and before each of these towers\n\nlay, as warder, a gigantic winged bull carved in stone, with a human\n\nhead, bearded and solemn. Nitetis gazed at these gates in astonishment,\n\nand then a joyful smile lighted up her face, as she looked up the long\n\nbroad street so brightly and beautifully decorated to welcome her.\n\n\n\nThe moment they beheld the king and the gilded carriage, the multitude\n\nburst into loud shouts of joy, but when Bartja, the people's darling,\n\ncame in sight, the shouts rose to thunder-peals and shrieks of delight,\n\nwhich seemed as if they would never end. It was long since the populace\n\nhad seen Cambyses, for in accordance with Median customs the king seldom\n\nappeared in public. Like the Deity, he was to govern invisibly, and his\n\noccasional appearance before the nation to be looked upon as a festival\n\nand occasion of rejoicing. Thus all Babylon had come out to-day to\n\nlook upon their awful ruler and to welcome their favorite Bartja on his\n\nreturn. The windows were crowded with eager, curious women, who threw\n\nflowers before the approaching train, or poured sweet perfumes from\n\nabove as they passed by. The pavement was thickly strewn with myrtle\n\nand palm branches, trees of different kinds had been placed before the\n\nhouse-doors, carpets and gay cloths hung from the windows, garlands of\n\nflowers were wreathed from house to house, fragrant odors of incense and\n\nsandal-wood perfumed the air, and th"}, {"true_sum": "In this book excerpt, the Bird boys have landed their biplane on the open campus of their high school during a race against their rival, Percy.

He would sell\n\nthe biggest farm he owned, which had been to him in its importance like\n\nthe flour-mill itself. He had had an offer for it that very day, and\n\na bigger offer still a week before. It was mortgaged to within eight\n\nthousand dollars of what it could be sold for but, if he could gain\n\ntime, that eight thousand dollars would build the mill again. M.

With this thought in his mind he went to sleep\n\nat last, and he did not wake till the sun was high.\n\n\n\nIt was a sun of the most wonderful brightness and warmth.

When Carmen went, when Zoe fled, when his\n\ncousin Auguste Charron took his flight, when defeats at law abashed\n\nhim, the house and mills, and stores and offices, and goodly trees, and\n\nwell-kept yards and barns and cattle-sheds all looked the same. Thus\n\nit was that he had been fortified. In one sense his miseries had seemed\n\nunreal, because all was the same in the outward scene. It was as though\n\nit all said to him: \"It is a dream that those you love have vanished,\n\nthat ill-fortune sits by your fireside. One night you will go to bed\n\nthinking that wife and child have gone, that your treasury is nearly\n\nempty; and in the morning you will wake up and find your loved ones\n\nsitting in their accustomed places, and your treasury will be full to\n\noverflowing as of old.\"\n\n\n\nSo it was while the picture of his home scene remained unbroken and\n\nserene; but the hideous mass of last night's holocaust was now before\n\nhis eyes, with little streams of smoke rising from the cindered\n\npile, and a hundred things with which his eyes had been familiar lay\n\ndistorted, excoriated and useless. He realized with sudden completeness\n\nthat a terrible change bad come in his life, that a cyclone had ruined\n\nthe face of his created world.\n\n\n\nThis picture did more to open up Jean Jacques' eyes to his real position\n\nin life than anything he had experienced, than any sorrow he had\n\nsuffered.

It was then somewhat past the middle of April,\nand the fest came off at Whitsuntide, in the middle of May. We, among\nothers, were engaged to strengthen the Cologne orchestra for the\noccasion, and we were bidden this morning to the first probe.\n\nWe just caught our train, seeing one or two faces of comrades we knew,\nand in an hour were in K\u00f6ln.\n\n\"The Tower of Babel,\" and Raff's Fifth Symphonie, that called \"Lenore,\"\nwere the subjects we had been summoned to practice.

There was an opera that night to which we had probe that\nafternoon, and I scarcely had time to rush home and give a look at\nSigmund before it was time to go again to the theater.\n\nEugen's place remained empty.

Darkness! After I had stood still and gazed about for a\ntime, my eyes grew accustomed to the obscurity. I perceived that a dim\ngray light still stole in at the open window, and that some one reposing\nin an easy-chair was faintly shadowed out against it.\n\n\"Is that you, Friedhelm?\" asked Eugen's voice.\n\n\"_Lieber Himmel!_ Are you there?

I can see what a great\n\ninfluence such reports would have if they came from Christian laymen. We\n\nhave learned to expect stories of complete failure when the ordinary\n\ntraveler comes back; and maybe the missionaries have their bias too. But\n\nbusiness men with Christian ideals--that would be different.\"\n\n\n\nNow, all this was far from unpleasant to J.W. He detested posing, but\n\nwhy wouldn't it be worth something to have laymen report on missionary\n\nwork? Of course, though, if the time ever came when the firm was willing\n\nto trust him abroad, he wouldn't have much chance to study missions.\n\nBusiness would have to come first. It was no less a dream for being an\n\nagreeable one.\n\n\n\n\"There's no danger of my going,\" he told them. \"The Cummings people are\n\nnot sending cub salesmen to promote their big Asiatic trade.

Joe Carbrook and\n\nMarcia are in China by now, and I'd like to see both of 'em as they get\n\ndown to work. You can't keep all our interest on this side of the\n\nPacific so long as those two are on the other.\"\n\n\n\n\"No,\" said J.W., warmly, \"and I don't want to. I'll help to back up\n\nthose two missionaries wherever they go.\" And his thoughts went back to\n\ncamp fire night at Cartwright Institute, when he had said to Joe\n\nCarbrook without suspecting the consequences, \"Say, Joe; if you think\n\nyou could be a doctor, why not a missionary doctor?\"\n\n\n\nThen he asked the company, \"Just where have these missionary infants\n\nbeen sent?\"\n\n\n\nNobody knew, exactly. They had the name of the town and the province,\n\nbut the geography of China is not as yet familiar even to those who\n\nsupport the missions and missionaries of that vast, mysterious land.\n\n\n\nThe pastor thought it was two or three hundred miles inland from\n\nFoochow. \"Anyhow,\" said he, \"it is a good-sized town, of about one\n\nhundred thousand people or more, and Joe's hospital is the only one in\n\nthe whole district. The man whose place he takes is home on furlough,\n\nand I've looked up his work in the Annual Report of the Foreign Missions\n\nBoard. Six or eight years ago the hospital was a building of sun-dried\n\nbrick, with a mud floor and accommodations for about seventy-five\n\npatients.

Since the Revolution the manners and customs of the bourgeois\n\nhave invaded the homes of the aristocracy. This misfortune is due to one\n\nof their writers, Rousseau, an infamous heretic, whose ideas were all\n\nanti-social and who pretended, I don't know how, to justify the most\n\nsenseless things. He declared that all women had the same rights and\n\nthe same faculties; that living in a state of society we ought,\n\nnevertheless, to obey nature--as if the wife of a Spanish grandee, as\n\nif you or I had anything in common with the women of the people! Since\n\nthen, well-bred women have suckled their children, have educated their\n\ndaughters, and stayed in their own homes. Life has become so involved\n\nthat happiness is almost impossible,--for a perfect harmony between\n\nnatures such as that which has made you and me live as two friends is an\n\nexception. Perpetual contact is as dangerous for parents and children as\n\nit is for husband and wife. There are few souls in which love survives\n\nthis fatal omnipresence. Therefore, I say, erect between yourself and\n\nPaul the barriers of society; go to balls and operas; go out in the\n\nmorning, dine out in the evenings, pay visits constantly, and grant but\n\nlittle of your time to your husband. By this means you will always keep\n\nyour value to him. When two beings bound together for life have\n\nnothing to live upon but sentiment, its resources are soon exhausted,\n\nindifference, satiety, and disgust succeed. When sentiment has withered\n\nwhat will become of you? Remember, affection once extinguished can lead\n\nto nothing but indifference or contempt. Be ever young and ever new to\n\nhim. He may weary you,--that often happens,--but you must never weary\n\nhim. The faculty of being bored without showing it is a condition of\n\nall species of power. You cannot diversify happiness by the cares of\n\nproperty or the occupations of a family. If you do not make your husband\n\nshare your social interests, if you do not keep him amused you will fall\n\ninto a dismal apathy. Then begins the SPLEEN of love.

For the study of this, Mrs. March realized, more and more\n\npassionately, that they were in the very most central and convenient\n\npoint, for the history of Wurzburg might be said to have begun with her\n\nprince-bishops, whose rule had begun in the twelfth century, and who had\n\nbuilt, on a forgotten Roman work, the fortress of the Marienburg on that\n\nvineyarded hill over against the Swan Inn. There had of course been\n\nhistory before that, but 'nothing so clear, nothing so peculiarly swell,\n\nnothing that so united the glory of this world and the next as that of\n\nthe prince-bishops. They had made the Marienburg their home, and kept it\n\nagainst foreign and domestic foes for five hundred years. Shut within its\n\nwell-armed walls they had awed the often-turbulent city across the Main;\n\nthey had held it against the embattled farmers in the Peasants' War, and\n\nhad splendidly lost it to Gustavus Adolphus, and then got it back again\n\nand held it till Napoleon took it from them. He gave it with their flock\n\nto the Bavarians, who in turn briefly yielded it to the Prussians in\n\n1866, and were now in apparently final possession of it.\n\n\n\nBefore the prince-bishops, Charlemagne and Barbarossa had come and gone,\n\nand since the prince-bishops there had been visiting thrones and kingdoms\n\nenough in the ancient city, which was soon to be illustrated by the\n\npresence of imperial Germany, royal, Wirtemberg and Saxony, grand-ducal\n\nBaden and Weimar, and a surfeit of all the minor potentates among those\n\nwho speak the beautiful language of the Ja.\n\n\n\nBut none of these could dislodge the prince-bishops from that supreme\n\nplace which they had at once taken in Mrs. March's fancy. The potentates\n\nwere all going to be housed in the vast palace which the prince-bishops\n\nhad built themselves in Wurzburg as soon as they found it safe to come\n\ndown from their stronghold of Marienburg, and begin to adorn their city,\n\nand to confirm it in its intense fidelity to the Church.

It prevailed so universally in\n\nWurzburg that it left her with the name of the Rococo City, intrenched in\n\na period of time equally remote from early Christianity and modern\n\nProtestantism. Out of her sixty thousand souls, only ten thousand are now\n\nof the reformed religion, and these bear about the same relation to the\n\nCatholic spirit of the place that the Gothic architecture bears to the\n\nbaroque.\n\n\n\nAs long as the prince-bishops lasted the Wurzburgers got on very well\n\nwith but one newspaper, and perhaps the smallest amount of merrymaking\n\nknown outside of the colony of Massachusetts Bay at the same epoch.

When we were\n\nbetween that island and the continent, we saw a vast number of fires\n\nalong the shore and half-way up the mountain, from whence we concluded\n\nthat the country must be very populous.  We were often detained on this\n\ncoast by calms, and frequently observed small trees, bamboos, and shrubs,\n\nwhich the rivers on that coast carried into the sea; from which we\n\ninferred that this part of the country was extremely well watered, and\n\nthat the land must be very good.

For nearly an hour I went to\n\nthis side and that, keeping a sharp look-out, but in vain; for I could\n\nsee nothing to which the rope could be fastened, and I was in the\n\ngreatest perplexity as to what was to be done. It was of no use thinking\n\nof getting down on the canal side or by the court of the palace, and the\n\nchurch offered only precipices which led to nothing. To get to the other\n\nside of the church towards the Canonica, I should have had to climb roofs\n\nso steep that I saw no prospect of success.

My eye caught a window on the canal sides, and\n\ntwo-thirds of the distance from the gutter to the summit of the roof. It\n\nwas a good distance from the spot I had set out from, so I concluded that\n\nthe garret lighted by it did not form part of the prison I had just\n\nbroken. It could only light a loft, inhabited or uninhabited, above some\n\nrooms in the palace, the doors of which would probably be opened by\n\nday-break.

Cruisers lost included the _Defense_, of\n\n14,600 tons; the _Black Prince_; of 13,550 tons, and the _Warrior_, of\n\n13,550 tons. The giant battle cruiser _Marlborough,_ of 27,500 tons,\n\nhad been badly damaged, as had the _Lion_ and other vessels. The\n\ndestroyers _Tipperary, Turbulent, Nestore, Alcaster, Fortune, Sparrow\n\nHawk, Ardent_ and _Shark_ had been sunk. Total losses ran high into the\n\nmillions and in the number of men above 7,000.\n\n\n\nThe German losses had been less, but nevertheless, taking into\n\nconsideration damage done to the effectiveness of the two fleets as a\n\nwhole, the enemy had sustained the harder blow. The British fleet still\n\nmaintained control of the North Sea, while the Germans, because of\n\ntheir losses, had been deprived of a large part of the fighting\n\nstrength of their fleet. The British, in spite of their heavier losses,\n\nwould recover more quickly than could the enemy.\n\n\n\nThe dreadnaught _Westphalen_ was the largest ship lost by the Germans.\n\nIt was of 18,600 tons. The three German battleships lost, the\n\n_Pommern_, the _Freiderich_ and the _Frauenlob_, were each of 13,350\n\ntons. Four battle cruisers had been sent to the bottom. They were the\n\n_Elbing_, the _Essen_, the _Lutzow_ and the _Hindenburg_, each of\n\n14,400 tons. The German losses in torpedo destroyers had been\n\nparticularly heavy, an even dozen having been sent to the bottom.\n\nBesides this, the enemy had lost three submarines and two Zeppelin\n\nairships, besides a number of smaller aircraft. In men the Germans had\n\nlost slightly less than the British.\n\n\n\nAnd so both British and Germans counted the battle a victory; the\n\nGermans because in total tonnage sunk they had the best of it; the\n\nBritish, because they held the scene of battle when the fighting was\n\nover and because the enemy had retired.\n\n\n\nBut, no matter with which side rested the victory, there was no\n\ngainsaying the fact that the battle of Jutland was the greatest naval\n\nstruggle of all time.\n\n\n\nAfter giving up pursuit of the enemy, the British withdrew.

Last evening, before he went\n\nto bed, the picture had been very different. Moor rarely painted by\n\ncandlelight and he had heard him come home late, yet now--now....\n\n\n\nHe was roused from these thoughts by the artist, who had been feasting\n\nhis eyes a long time on the handsome lad, now rapidly developing into a\n\nyouth, as he stood before the canvas as if spellbound.

At last, shaking\n\nhis head, he murmured in an undertone: \"Yes, but those shadows at\n\nthe corners of the mouth--do you see?--that light on the brow, and\n\nthere--just look at the nostrils--I certainly did not paint those.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't think them so much amiss,\" replied Moor. \"Whatever friendly\n\nspirits now work for you at night, you must learn in Antwerp to paint in\n\nbroad day at any hour.\"\n\n\n\n\"In Antwerp?\"\n\n\n\n\"We shall prepare for departure this very day.

He did make of necessity virtue, of such\n\nbread such pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the shaven.\n\nEvery morning he did cast up his gorge, and his father's little dogs eat\n\nout of the dish with him, and he with them.  He would bite their ears, and\n\nthey would scratch his nose--he would blow in their arses, and they would\n\nlick his chaps.\n\n\n\nBut hearken, good fellows, the spigot ill betake you, and whirl round your\n\nbrains, if you do not give ear!

Which codpiece, or\n\nbraguette, his governesses did every day deck up and adorn with fair\n\nnosegays, curious rubies, sweet flowers, and fine silken tufts, and very\n\npleasantly would pass their time in taking you know what between their\n\nfingers, and dandling it, till it did revive and creep up to the bulk and\n\nstiffness of a suppository, or street magdaleon, which is a hard rolled-up\n\nsalve spread upon leather.  Then did they burst out in laughing, when they\n\nsaw it lift up its ears, as if the sport had liked them.

He had had more adventures on\nthis trip than any other member of the outfit. First he was tossed over\na high brush by the ox Dave; then, shortly after, he was pitched\nheadlong over a barbed wire fence by an irate cow. Next came a fight\nwith a wolf; following this, came a narrow escape from a rattlesnake in\nthe road. Also, a trolley car ran on to him, rolling him over and over\nagain until he came out as dizzy as a drunken man. I thought he was a\n\"goner\" that time for sure, but he soon straightened up. Finally, in the\nstreets of Kansas City, he was run over by a heavy truck while fighting\nwith another dog. The other dog was killed outright, while Jim came near\nto having his neck broken. He lost one of his best fighting teeth and\nhad several others broken. I sent him to a veterinary surgeon, and\ncuriously enough he made no protest while having the broken teeth\nrepaired or extracted.\n\nThere was no other way to find Jim than to offer a reward. I did this,\nand feel sure I paid twenty dollars to one of the parties to the theft.\nThe fellow was brazen enough, also, to demand pay for keeping him. That\nwas the time when I got up and talked pointedly.\n\nBut I had my faithful dog back, and I kept him more closely by me while\nI was making the rest of my tour. Six years later it chanced that I lost\nJim. While we were waiting at a station, I let him out of the car for a\nfew minutes. The train started unexpectedly and Jim was left behind. A\ngood reward was offered for him, but nobody ever came to collect it.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: Welcomed by President Roosevelt at the Capitol.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\n\nTHE END OF THE LONG TRAIL\n\n\nI WAS glad enough to get out of the crowds of New York. It had given me\nsome rich experiences, but that big city is no place for ox teams. It\nwas good to get away from the jam and the hurry out on to the country\nroads.\n\nOn the way to Philadelphia, between Newark and Elizabeth City, New\nJersey, at a point known as Lyon's Farm, the old Meeker homestead stood,\nbuilt in the year 1676. Here the Meeker Tribe, as we call ourselves,\ncame out to greet me, nearly forty strong.\n\nOn the way through Maryland we saw a good many oxen, some of them driven\non the road. The funny part of it was to have the owners try to trade\ntheir scrawny teams for Dave and Dandy, offering money to boot, or two\nyoke for one. They had never before seen such large oxen as Dave and\nDandy, and for that matter I never had myself. Dandy was of unusual\nsize, and Dave was probably the largest trained ox in the United States\nthen; he was sixteen hands high and eight feet in girth.\n\nI reached Washington, the capital, just twenty-two months to the day\nfrom the time I left home in Washington, the state. As soon as\narrangements could be made I went to see President Roosevelt. Senator\nPiles and Representative Cushman, of the Washington Congressional\ndelegation, introduced me to the President in the cabinet room.\n\nMr. Roosevelt manifested a lively interest in the work of marking the\ntrail. He did not need to be told that the trail was a battlefield, or\nthat the Oregon pioneers who moved out and occupied the Oregon Country\nwhile it was yet in dispute between Great Britain and the United States\nwere heroes.
